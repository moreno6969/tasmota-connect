If your Tasmota device is not listed below, choose a **Generic** device that is similar to your Tasmota device.

* **Generic Switch** (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8CH) - No Power Monitoring
* **Generic Metering Switch** (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8CH) - Power Monitoring
* **Generic Dimmer Switch**
* **Generic IR Bridge**
* **Generic Light (CT)**
* **Generic Light (RGB)**

## Virtual Device
A Virtual Device uses a RF or IR bridge to control or read your dumb RF / IR devices.

Virtual Device | Usage
---- | ----
Virtual Switch          | Add a SmartThings generic switch that can be controlled by a RF / IR bridge (e.g. Sonoff RF Bridge).
Virtual Shade           | Add a SmartThings shade/blind that can be controlled by a RF / IR bridge (e.g. Sonoff RF Bridge).
Virtual Button          | Add RF/IR remote controller 1/2/4/6-button as SmartThings remote controller button.
Virtual Contact Sensor  | Add a RF contact sensor
Virtual Motion Sensor   | Add a RF motion sensor
Virtual Air Conditioner | Add a IR virtual air conditioner ([supported AC vendor/brands](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Tasmota-IR/#sending-irhvac-commands)) <br><br>(optional) Use a contact sensor to sense if the AC is ON or OFF.

#### Configuring a Virtual Switch
1. Choose a RF or IR Bridge
2. Enter the Tasmota command to send for "ON" and "OFF"
      
      For RF, it has to be one of these formats
      
      * `Backlog RfSync <value>; RfLow <value>; RfHigh <value>; RfCode <value>`      
      * `Backlog RfRaw <value>; RfRaw 0`
         > Note: RFRaw requires [Portisch Firmware](https://github.com/Portisch/RF-Bridge-EFM8BB1)
     
3. Optionally, enable `State tracking` to listen for RF codes (e.g. from RF remote) to simulate a Stateful device
4. If you enable `State tracking`, enter the code that represents the "ON" and "OFF" state
       
   In the example below, the code is **70C70F**
   
   * "RfReceived":{"Sync":7110,"Low":210,"High":660,"Data":"**70C70F**","RfKey":"None"}

#### Configuring a Virtual Contact / Motion Sensor / Button
1. Choose a RF Bridge
2. Enter the RFReceived Data that represents "OPEN", "CLOSE", "ACTIVE", "INACTIVE" or button state
             
   In the example below, the code is **70C70F**
   
   * "RfReceived":{"Sync":7110,"Low":210,"High":660,"Data":"**70C70F**","RfKey":"None"}

#### Configuring a Virtual Air Conditioner
1. Choose an IR Bridge
2. Select air conditioner brand ([supported AC vendor/brands](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Tasmota-IR/#sending-irhvac-commands))
3. (Optional) Select a contact sensor to sense if the AC is ON or OFF

## FAQ

#### My Tasmota device is not responding?
* Verify the IP address is correct and you are able to access your device via the IP address.
* If you have added this device using other developer device type handler (DTH), please delete the device.
* If the device is still not responding, look at the Tasmota Console so that you can see exactly what is happening. e.g. The actions (on/off) that you've called in SmartThings App didn't appear in the Console, it's likely the SmartThings hub is unable to access the device.
* Ensure your Tasmota devices and SmartThings hub are assigned with static IP addresses.

####  Where can I find out more about Tasmota command for sending/receiving IR / RF codes?
Please see under RF Bridge & IR Remote - https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Commands/

#### The Tasmota (Connect) SmartApp is not showing up in SmartThings App?
* Sign in to SmartThings IDE: https://account.smartthings.com/login 
* Verify that you have installed the codes in the correct SmartThings IDE Shard.
* If you don't see your current devices under "My Devices", you are probably on the wrong shard.

#### I'm unable to find the recently released features (or missing features or devices) in my SmartApp?
* Please make sure you install the SmartApp and all Device Handlers, and update the codes regularly to receive the latest features

#### I created a generic/metering switch with 2 (or more) channels, but it shows only 1 switch?
* Please make sure you install the SmartApp and all Device Handlers, and update the codes regularly to receive the latest features
